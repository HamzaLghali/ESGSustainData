üåç Sustain Data: A Journey into ESG through Big Data üìä

Have you ever wondered why Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) topics are shaping the future of businesses and investments? Despite its growing importance, I realized that many in the tech domain specially in Morocco remain unfamiliar with ESG. That's what inspired me to create Sustain Data project aimed at introducing ESG through the lens of data engineering and visualization.

What is ESG?
ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance, a framework for assessing how companies perform on responsibility metrics:

Environmental: How does a company safeguard the environment? Think renewable energy, resource efficiency, and climate change mitigation.
Social: How does it manage relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and communities? This includes diversity, labor practices, and community engagement.
Governance: How effective and ethical is its leadership? This involves executive pay, audits, internal controls, and shareholder rights.

The Sustain Data Project
This project dives into ESG by focusing on one key indicator per domain:


Environment: Renewable energy consumption, Heating Degree Days
Social: Income share held
Governance:
Using World Bank datasets, I explored how these metrics interconnect and influence each other. The entire project is a big data engineering showcase, utilizing Azure Databricks Notebooks, PySpark, and Power BI to process, analyze, and visualize the data.

 Why Sustain Data?

I wanted to not only develop a technical project but also create a resource for those curious about ESG. By exploring the visualizations and reading the documentation, even beginners can understand the significance of ESG metrics and their potential for shaping a sustainable future.

ESG is not just a buzzword‚Äîit's the future. Through this project, I hope to contribute to its understanding and adoption, especially within the tech and data engineering communities. Let's build a sustainable future together! add whatever needed and generate another file for readme
