## 🌍 Sustain Data: A Journey into ESG through Big Data 📊
Welcome to Sustain Data, an innovative data engineering project that merges the power of big data with the principles of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG). This project is designed to educate, inspire, and drive awareness about the critical role ESG metrics play in shaping sustainable business practices.

## 📌 What is ESG?
ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance, a framework used to evaluate how responsibly companies operate in the following domains:

#### Environmental:
Focuses on how a company safeguards the environment, with indicators like renewable energy usage, waste management, and climate change mitigation.
#### Social:
Examines how a company manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and communities. Metrics here might include diversity, labor practices, and societal impact.
#### Governance:
Evaluates leadership ethics and corporate governance practices, including executive pay, internal audits, shareholder rights, and accountability.
ESG metrics are not just buzzwords—they are increasingly vital for businesses, investors, and regulators aiming to build a sustainable future.
