# üåç Sustain Data: A Journey into ESG through Big Data üìä
Have you ever wondered why Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) topics are shaping the future of global sustainability? Despite its growing importance, I realized that many in the tech domain, especially in Morocco, remain unfamiliar with ESG. This inspired me to create the Sustain Data project‚Äîa unique exploration of ESG concepts through data engineering and visualization.

## Why Sustain Data?
This project is not just a technical showcase but also a resource for anyone curious about ESG. By examining visualizations and reviewing the analysis, even beginners can grasp the importance of ESG metrics and their potential for shaping a sustainable future.

## What is ESG?
ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance, a framework for assessing responsibility metrics. While ESG is often used to evaluate companies, this project applies the same principles to countries, offering insights into how nations perform across key sustainability dimensions:

Environmental: How does a country safeguard the environment? Indicators include renewable energy consumption, resource efficiency, and climate adaptation.
Social: How does it manage societal equity and well-being? Metrics include income distribution, labor practices, and community engagement.
Governance: How effective and ethical is its leadership? This involves governance quality, accountability, and public participation.
The Sustain Data Project
This project explores ESG indicators for countries in the Middle East & North Africa and Europe & Central Asia regions, including Morocco, Netherlands, Qatar, France, Belgium, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates.

## Indicators:
#### Environment:
Renewable energy consumption.
Heating and Cooling Degree Days.
#### Social:
Income share as a measure of social equity.
#### Governance:
Voice and Accountability as an indicator of governance quality.
Metrics and Insights
## Environment Metrics:
Energy Efficiency in Hotter Climates: Examines the relationship between renewable energy consumption and cooling degree days.
Impact of Temperature on Renewable Energy: Analyzes how climate impacts renewable energy use over time.
Trend of Cooling Degree Days: Tracks changes in cooling energy demand across countries.
Correlation Analysis: Explores relationships between cooling degree days and renewable energy usage.
Average Renewable Energy Consumption: Highlights top countries in renewable energy adoption.
Renewable Energy Adoption Rankings: Ranks countries based on their renewable energy consumption for the latest year.
## Social Metrics:
Income Share Analysis: Studies income distribution patterns to assess social equity across countries.
## Governance Metrics:
Voice and Accountability: Evaluates the quality of governance and citizen participation in decision-making.


## Why ESG Matters?
ESG is not just a buzzword it‚Äôs the future. By focusing on the ESG performance of countries, this project broadens the scope of sustainability discussions, providing valuable insights for governments, researchers, and policymakers. Through Sustain Data, I aim to contribute to the understanding and adoption of ESG principles, particularly within the tech and data engineering communities.

Let‚Äôs build a sustainable future together! üåç
